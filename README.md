### This project couldn't be possible without these cool libraries:
* **[HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS)** — a Node.js implementation of HomeKit Accessory Server.
* **[miIO Device Library](https://github.com/aholstenson/miio)** — Control Mi Home devices that implement the miIO protocol, such as the Mi Air Purifier, Mi Robot Vacuum and Mi Smart Socket. These devices are commonly part of what Xiaomi calls the Mi Ecosystem which is branded as MiJia.
